Heart Disease Prediction Project
🚀 Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical data using machine learning. The dataset contains various features like age, cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced angina. After preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, the best model was selected for deployment.🗂 Dataset
Target variable (target):
0 → No heart disease
1 → Has heart disease
